# Appturbo - PHP exercise

This is the repository with the exercise for the Appturbo interview.

Read the contents of this **README.md** carefully as it will help you to set up this exercise.

In this exercise, you will have to code a micro project using PHP.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
This project uses all the classic stack tools to code in PHP, so you'll need:

* a **web server with PHP** enabled (>= 5.3 required)
* a **git** client to clone the sources
* the **PHPUnit** testing tool (you can grab it [here](https://phpunit.de)), it's a simple PHP script which
can be run with a PHP interpreter (like **composer**)


### Clone the Project skeleton
This repository uses **git**, you should clone it on your machine through a git clone.

## It's up to you now!
Now read the **INSTRUCTIONS.md** file located at the root of the project. It contains all the instructions and hints
for the project.

## Submitting your solution
To submit your solution, you can simply do a **Pull Request** on the exercise repository.
You can also submit your *src/PhpExerciseProblem* folder with the solution in an ZIP archive.

## How you will be evaluated

A bunch of tests have been written under the *tests* and example file under the *example*, we will check the output.

### Procedure which will be executed to test your solution

* We will clone your sources
* We will set up the project
* We will launch the tests with PHP Unit `phpunit`

### About the results
The results are important but there is no unique solution, there are various way to pass the tests successfully.
We prefer a not so perfect solution than no solution at all even if you have to change a little bit the structure of the project.
We will check your coding style and PHP notions.

**Don't forget that you will have to explain and justify your choices during an interview. This exercise is a way
to provide discussion material for it.**
